# Software-Testing
Based on JUnit,
 I successfully carried out the test plans that meet graph-based criteria by edge-pair coverage. Though all tests are passed, I don’t think it is a practical test plan for this
game. Since all I have checked in these tests is the final page is to the end of the graph, which is also the starting edge, I didn’t check any status in the process. The functional
parts are essential and should be tested for a web game. The test plans carried out by me just testified that the game is playable.
Besides,I designed the test cases to cover ISP Coverage criteria. I created table of test requirements to meet the Base Choice and Base Choice criteria
